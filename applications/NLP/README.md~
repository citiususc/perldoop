# Natural Language Processing #

Here you can find a full working **Perldoop** application. In this case we are talking about the NLP modules.
To build these modules you can just run the _NLP-Compile.sh_ bash script, and it will do all the work for you. The generated files are organized as follows:

* _JavaTemplates_ This is where Java templates are stored. You don't need to modify these files, they are used by **Perldoop** to create the final Java codes.
* _JavaTranslatedCode_ Here is where the automatically generated Java source code is stored.
* _JavaGeneratedClasses_ In this directory is where the _NLP-Compile.sh_ stores the .class files.
* _JavaProgram_ And here is where the final .jar file is stored. This file is the one you can run within Hadoop.
* _Text_ A small input text example has been stored here.
